# pi-plan
Idea for PI Planning Tool

What I would like to do is use ReactJS to create a mini-application 
that will have a list of features and allow them to be dragged and dropped
into sprints within a PI (program increment).

I am going to see about creating custom components to serve as the story
note cards and sprint docking areas.

Strategy is to use hardcoded JSON data at first to generate the feature cards.
Start with just titles and four fixed columns to represent sprints. I want
to get the card look, the channel look (where the stuff will drop), and the drag
and drop action to be all cool and working before I focus on the card detail
and any model organization.
